# cudss_permute 

## Build 
cuDSS path should be passed to cmake. The example below where to it is installed by default on Windows. 
```
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:\Program Files\NVIDIA cuDSS\v0.6\lib\12\cmake" ..
```

Depending on the system, this will generate either a `.sln` project on Windows or a `make` file for a Linux system. 

## Run 
```
./test_cudss matrix.mtx <permute_type>
```
The `<permute_type>` argument can be one of the following:

- `default`
- `metis`
- `symrcm`
- `symamd`

A few example `.mtx` matrices are provided in the `/data` directory. A larger matrix is also provided as a `.zip` file; you can decompress it for more intensive testing.

## Scripts Usage

Three convenience scripts are provided to manage the workflow of generating and reusing permutations and elimination trees.

### 1. `run_generate.sh`
This script is used to save the cuDSS elimination tree and permutation.
> **Note:** Ensure you update the script with the correct addresses/paths for your data file.

### 2. `run_parth.sh`
Use this script to generate different permutations and elimination trees (e.g., using Parth).

### 3. `run_reuse.sh`
This script is used to reuse the elimination trees and permutations generated by the previous steps.
